<h1>6502bench SourceGen: Tools</h1>

<h2><a name="instruction-chart">Instruction Chart</a></h2>

<p>This opens a window with a summary of all 256 opcodes.  The CPU can
be chosen from the pop-up list at the bottom.  Undocumented opcodes for
6502/65C02 are shown in italics, and can be excluded from the list
by unchecking the box at the bottom.</p>
<p>The status flags affected by each instruction reflect their behavior
on the 65816.  The only significant difference between 65816 and
6502/65C02 is the way the BRK instruction affects the D and B/X flags.</p>


<h2><a name="ascii-chart">ASCII Chart</a></h2>

<p>This opens a window with the ASCII character set.  Each character is
displayed next to its numeric value in decimal and hexadecimal.  The
pop-up list at the bottom allows you to flip between standard and "high"
ASCII.</p>


<h2><a name="hexdump">Hex Dump Viewer</a></h2>

<p>You can use this to view the contents of the project data file
by double-clicking the "bytes" column, or with Actions &gt; Show Hex Dump.
The viewer is displayed in a "modeless" dialog that does not
prevent you from continuing to work with the project.  If you
double-click a different line in the project, the viewer will automatically
highlight those bytes.</p>

<p>You can also use this to view the contents of arbitrary files by
using Tools &gt; Hex Dump.  There is no fixed limit on the number of
viewers you can have open simultaneously.  (Be aware that the viewer
currently loads the entire file into memory, and you will run out of room
eventually.  Not coincidentally, the viewer has a size limit of 16MiB
per file.)</p>

<p>You can select lines with the mouse as you would in any other list
view.  Ctrl+A selects all lines.  Ctrl+C copies the selected lines to
the system clipboard.</p>

<p>The "character conversion" selector allows you to choose how the
bytes are converted to characters for the Text column.  Choose from
the usual set of encodings.</p>

<p>If "ASCII-only dump" is not checked, non-printable bytes are shown in
the ASCII dump as a middle dot ('&#183;').  If the box is checked,
non-printable bytes are represented by a period ('.') instead.  The
use of non-ASCII characters makes the dump unambiguous when unprintable
characters are mixed with periods, but the lines may be unsuitable for
pasting in some forums.</p>

<p>If "always on top" is checked, the window will stay above all other
windows that don't also declare that they should always be on top.  By
default this box is checked when displaying project data, and not checked for
external files.</p>


<h2><a name="file-concat">File Concatenator</a></h2>

<p>The File Concatenator combines multiple files into a single file.
Select the files to add, arrange them in the proper order, then hit
"Save".  CRC-32 values are shown for reference.</p>


<h2><a name="file-slicer">File Slicer</a></h2>

<p>The File Slicer allows you to "slice" a piece out of a file, saving
it to a new file.  Specify the start and length in decimal or hex.  If
you leave a field blank, they will default to offset 0 and the remaining
length of the file, respectively.</p>
<p>The hex dumps show the area just before and after the chunk to be
sliced, allowing you to confirm the placement.</p>


<h2><a name="omf-converter">OMF Converter</a></h2>

<p>This tool allows you to view Apple IIgs Object Module Format
binaries, and convert them for disassembly.  OMF files have multiple
segments with relocatable code.  The conversion tool loads the OMF
file the same way the GS/OS System Loader would, and creates a
SourceGen project file for it with some basic attributes filled in.</p>

<p>Only Load files may be converted (S16, PIF, etc).  Compiler object
files and libraries contain unresolved references and are not supported.</p>

<p>The generated binary file is not in OMF format and will not execute
on an Apple IIgs.</p>
