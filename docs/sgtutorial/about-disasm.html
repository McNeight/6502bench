    <div class="grid-item-text">
		<p>Well-written assembly-language source code has meaningful
        comments and labels, so that humans can read and understand it.
        For example:</p>
<pre>
          .org  $2000
          sec                         ;set carry
          ror   A                     ;shift into high bit
          bmi   CopyData              ;branch always

          .asciiz "first string"
          .asciiz "another string"
          .asciiz "string the third"
          .asciiz "last string"

CopyData  lda   #&lt;addrs               ;get pointer into
          sta   ptr                   ; address table
          lda   #&gt;addrs
          sta   ptr+1
</pre>

        <p>Computers operate at a much lower level, so a piece of software
        called an <i>assembler</i> is used to convert the source code to
        object code that the CPU can execute.
        Object code looks more like this:</p>
<pre>
38 6a 30 39 66 69 72 73 74 20 73 74 72 69 6e 67
00 61 6e 6f 74 68 65 72 20 73 74 72 69 6e 67 00
73 74 72 69 6e 67 20 74 68 65 20 74 68 69 72 64
00 6c 61 73 74 20 73 74 72 69 6e 67 00 a9 63 85
02 a9 20 85 03
</pre>

		<p>This arrangement works perfectly well until somebody needs to
        modify the software and nobody can find the original sources.
        <i>Disassembly</i> is the act of taking a raw hex
        dump and converting it to source code.</p>

    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Disassembling a blob of data can be tricky.  A simple
        disassembler can format instructions, but can't generally tell
        the difference between instructions and data.  Many 6502 programs
        intermix code and data freely, so simply dumping everything as
        an instruction stream can result in sections with nonsensical output.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>One way to separate code from data is to try to execute all
        possible data paths.  There are a number of reasons why it's difficult
        or impossible to do this perfectly, but you can get pretty good
        results by identifying execution entry points and just walking through
        the code.  When a conditional branch is encountered, both paths are
        traversed.  When all code has been traced, every byte that hasn't
        been visited is either
        data used by the program, or dead space not used by anything.</p>

        <p>The process can be improved by keeping track of the flags in the
        6502 status register.  For example, in the code fragment shown
        earlier, <code>BMI</code> conditional branch instruction is used.
        A simple tracing algorithm would both follow the branch and fall
        through to the following instruction.  However, the code that precedes
        the <code>BMI</code> ensures that the branch is always taken, so a
        clever disassembler would only trace that path.</p>

        <p>(The situation is worse on the 65816, because the length of
        certain instructions is determined by the values of the processor
        status flags.)</p>

        <p>Once the instructions and data are separated and formatted
        nicely, it's still up to a human to figure out what it all means.
        Comments and meaningful labels are needed to make sense of it.
        These should be added to the disassembly listing.</p>

    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>SourceGen performs the instruction tracing, and makes it easy
        to format operands and add labels and comments.
        When the disassembled code is ready, SourceGen can generate source code
        for a variety of modern cross-assemblers, and produce HTML listings
        with embedded graphic visualizations.</p>
