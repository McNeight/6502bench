<h2>Using SourceGen</h2>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>This first section covers the basics of working with SourceGen: how to
        move around, make edits, generate code, and so on.
        SourceGen has some unusual features, so it's worth reading through this
        even if you've used other disassemblers.</p>

        <p>You can't do anything useful until you open an existing project or
        create a new one, so we'll start there.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>A SourceGen project is always associated with a data file, which
        holds part or all of the program being disassembled.
        For simplicity, the project is given the same name as the data file, with
        <code>.dis65</code> on the end.
        No part of the data file is included in the project file, so you need
        to keep both files in the same place.
        If the program you're disassembling was split into more than one data
        file, you'll need a separate project file for each.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">
        <img src="images/t1-fresh-install.png" alt="t1-fresh-install"/>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>To start a new project, launch SourceGen, and click on the
        "Start New Project" button on
        the initial screen, or use <samp>File &gt; New</samp>.  This opens the "New Project"
        window, which lets you specify the target system and data file.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">
        <img src="images/t1-new-project.png" alt="t1-new-project"/>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Choosing a target system, such as Apple //e or Commodore 64, will
        create a project configured with the appropriate CPU and options.
        If nothing in the list matches the file you want to work on,
        there are "generic" entries for each
        of the primary CPU varieties (6502, 65C02, W65C02, and 65816).  If
        you're unsure, just take your best guess.  It's easy to change things after the
        project has been started.</p>
        <p>The area on the right side of the window has a list of the files, scripts,
        and optional features that will be enabled for the
        selected system.  The various items here will be explained in more
        detail later on.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">
        <img src="images/t1-new-tutorial1.png" alt="t1-new-tutorial1"/>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>For this tutorial, we're going to use "<samp>Generic 6502</samp>",
        near the bottom of the list.</p>
        <p>The other thing we need to do here is select the data file to be
        disassembled.  Click <samp>Select File</samp>, navigate to the <samp>Examples</samp>
        directory in the SourceGen installation directory, open <samp>Tutorial</samp>,
        and select <samp>Tutorial1</samp>.
        <p>Click <samp>OK</samp> to create the project.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>The first thing you should do after creating a new project is save it.
        Some features create or load files from the directory where the project
        file lives, so we want to establish that.  Use <samp>File &gt; Save</samp>
        or <kbd class="key">Ctrl+S</kbd> to save it, with the default name
        (<kbd>Tutorial1.dis65</kbd>), in the directory where the data file lives.</p>
        <p>(It's okay to create the project in the installation directory.  You
        don't need to work off of a copy of the data file; SourceGen doesn't modify
        it, so you don't have to worry about trashing the example data.)</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">
        <img src="images/t1-settings.png" alt="t1-settings"/>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>The disassembly display can be tailored to your personal
		preferences.  Use <samp>Edit &gt; Settings</samp> to open the
		settings editor.  You can change fonts, upper/lower case, text
		delimiters, line wrapping, pseudo-op names, and more.  There
		are "quick set" buttons on some screens that allow you to make the
		output resemble various popular assemblers.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-text">
		<p>All app settings are local to your system, and do not affect
		the project in any way.  If somebody else opens the same project,
		they may see entirely different pseudo-ops and upper-case choices,
        based on their own personal preferences.
		(The settings that affect projects are accessed through a
		different screen, via <samp>Edit &gt; Project Properties</samp>.)</p>

        <p>For now, you can leave everything set to default values.</p>
