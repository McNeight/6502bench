<h2>Simple Edits</h2>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Click the very first line of the file, which is a comment that says
        something like "6502bench SourceGen vX.Y.Z".  There are three ways to
        open the comment editor:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Select <samp>Actions &gt; Edit Long Comment</samp> from the menu bar.</li>
          <li>Right click, and select <samp>Edit Long Comment</samp> from the
            pop-up menu.  (This menu is exactly the same as the Actions menu.)</li>
          <li>Double-click the comment</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Most things in the code list will respond to a double-click.
        Double-clicking on addresses, flags, labels, operands, and comments will
        open editors for those things.  Double-clicking on a value in the "bytes"
        column will open a floating hex dump viewer.  This is usually the most
        convenient way to edit something: point and click.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">
        <img src="images/t1-edit-long-comment.png" alt="t1-edit-long-comment"/>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Double-click the comment to open the editor.  Type some words into the
        upper window, and note that a formatted version appears in the bottom
        window.  Experiment with the maximum line width and "render in box"
        settings to see what they do.  You can hit Enter to create line breaks,
        or let SourceGen wrap lines for you.  When you're done, click <samp>OK</samp>.
        (Or hit <kbd class="key">Ctrl+Enter</kbd>.)</p>
        <p>When the dialog closes, you'll see your new comment in place at the
        top of the file.  If you typed enough words, your comment will span
        multiple lines.  You can select the comment by selecting any line in it.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <!--<div class="grid-item-image">
        <img src="images/t1-multi-disab.png" alt="t1-multi-disab"/>
    </div>-->
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Click on the comment, then shift-click on L1014.  Right-click, and look
        at the menu.  Nearly all of the menu items are disabled.  Most edit features
        are only enabled when a single instance of a relevant item is selected, so
        for example <samp>Edit Long Comment</samp> won't be enabled if you have an
        instruction selected.</p>

    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">
        <img src="images/t1-edit-note.png" alt="t1-edit-note"/>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Let's add a note.  Click on $100E (the line with "hello!"), then
        select <samp>Actions &gt; Edit Note</samp>.  Type a few words, pick a color,
        and click <samp>OK</samp> (or hit <kbd class="key">Ctrl+Enter</kbd>).
        Your note appears in the code, and also in the
        window on the bottom left.  Notes are like long comments, with three key
        differences:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You can't pick their line width, but you can pick their color.</li>
          <li>They don't appear in generated assembly sources, making them
            useful for leaving notes to yourself as you work.</li>
          <li>They're listed in the Notes window.  Double-clicking them jumps
            the selection to the note, making them useful as bookmarks.</li>
        </ol>

    </div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">
        <img src="images/t1-set-addr-1017.png" alt="t1-set-addr-1017"/>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>It's time to do something with the code.  If you look at what the code
        does you'll see that it's copying several dozen bytes from $1017
        to $2000, then jumping to $2000.  It appears to be relocating the next
        part of the code before
        executing it.  We want to let the disassembler know what's going on, so
        select the line at address $1017 and then
        <samp>Actions &gt; Set Address</samp>.  (Or double-click on
        "<code>1017</code>" in the <samp>Addr</samp> column.)
        In the <samp>Set Address</samp> dialog, type "<kbd>2000</kbd>", and hit Enter.)</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">
        <img src="images/t1-addr-chg-1017.png" alt="t1-addr-chg-1017"/>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Note the way the code list has changed.  When you changed the address,
        the <code>JMP $2000</code> at address $1014 found a home inside
        the bounds of the file, so
        the code tracer was able to find the instructions there.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>From the menu, select <samp>Edit &gt; Undo</samp>.  Notice how
        everything reverts to the way it was.  Now, select
        <samp>Edit &gt; Redo</samp> to restore the changes.  You can undo any change you
        make to the project.  (The undo history is <strong>not</strong> saved in
        the project file, though, so when you exit the program the history is
        lost.)</p>
        <p>As you make alterations to the addresses, notice that, while the
        <samp>Address</samp> column changes, the <samp>Offset</samp> column does not.
        File offsets never change, which is why they're shown here and
        in the References and Notes windows.  (They can, however, be distracting,
        so you'll be forgiven if you reduce the offset column width to zero.)</p>

    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Select the line with address $2003 ("CMP #$04"), then
        <samp>Actions &gt; Edit Operand</samp>.  This allows you to pick how you want the
        operand to look.  It's currently set to "Default", which for an 8-bit
        immediate argument means it's shown as a hexadecimal value.  Click
        "Binary", then "OK".  It now appears as a binary value.</p>

        <p>On that same line, select <samp>Actions &gt; Edit Comment</samp>.  Type a short
        comment, and hit <kbd class="key">Enter</kbd>.  Your comment appears
        in the "comment" column.</p>
