This is the project web site, served through GitHub Pages.  The URL
https://6502bench.com/ is mapped here.  Any change checked in to this part
of the tree is (almost) immediately visible on the web.

Many of the pages share common elements: masthead, top nav bar, side nav bar,
and footer.  These are inserted by a Python script (block-repl.py) that must
be run whenever one of the "-incl" files changes.
